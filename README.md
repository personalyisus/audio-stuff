## What is this repo?

This is a repository with my favorite EQ settings for the IEMs I own!

Keep in mind that my tastes aren't universal and some people
might enjoy different sound signatures, and I also have almost 
no clue what I'm doing with the EQ  :D 

## How to use the information on this repo?

Just try and import these files into sites like https://earphonesarchive.squig.link/
